# Hawk Shadow Loot Master

It's an addon for World of Warcraft I'm developping to help my guild get a customized Loot Master fitting our exact needs. This is mainly a toy project for me to get into WoW Addon development on my free time. It's currently piggy backing on the C_LootHistory API to fetch data and for now it has no other utility than mimicking the current Loot window.
In the future I would like to add features like :

<<<<<<< HEAD
 - A Button to anounce the loot in the RaidWarning channel for a "loot delivery" session

 - A Button to announce the loot in the RaidWarning channel for a "loot delivery" session
>>>>>>> 082849d (Reorganising a bunch of code)
 - A List of all the players that rolled for the item (sorted by /rand max and /rand value for example)
 - A DropDown to select the winner
 - A Button to try to automatically try to give away to the item to the winner if able (if the winner is in range try to give the loot to that player automatically)
